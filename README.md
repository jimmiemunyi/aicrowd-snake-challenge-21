The Snake Project
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

In this project I try to classify snake species. The end goal is to be
able to know which snakes are venomous and which ones are not with the
help of Deep Learning.

I will approach the goal from different sides. The initial plan it to
classifying the snakes using:

- Image Classification
- NLP

## a) Image Classification

### DriveTrain Approach

**Objective**: To determine whether a snake is venomous or not.

**Levers**: We can use image classification to identify the genus,
species and country of the snake, then use that information to infer
whether the snake is venomous or not.

**Data**: AI Crowd Species Identification Project. Can be found
[here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/snakeclef2021-snake-species-identification-challenge)

## b) NLP

(Coming Soon)

## Helpers

I am also writing as small library in parallel of helper functions that
I use repetively during the research called `tsp`.

It is not pushed to pypi or conda however, so you can only install it
from the repo. After cloning, run:

``` sh
pip install -e .
```
